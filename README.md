# Implementing Finite State Machine into Microchip PIC18F.

Hello there. This supposed to be part of my school's assignment, where we create a system using Finite State Machine Diagram and then implement the Machine into the assembly codes. Yeap, FSM supposed to be a design tool or a mathematical model of computation,however, in this code, we can actually implement it into the code.

Flow:
Identify desired system and functions --> Design the system in FSM --> Extract information from the diagram --> Implement it into the source code( ../QuellCode_FinalEx ).

Hope this helps!

Feel free to suggest/recommend if any changes need or ask if any question surfaced.
